# Personal TilEd Map renderer

A library for renderering/reading tiled maps created and edited by TilEd. This 
is being used for a couple of my game projects.

This library has three dependencies:
- [cul](https://github.com/ariajanke/util-common) (my personal utilities library)
- [TinyXML2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2)
- [zlib](https://zlib.net/)

This wonderful tool has a [website](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and a GitHub [repo](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled).

# Dependency Note

Like projects that use SFML, with TinyXML2 I simply use my OS package manager.
